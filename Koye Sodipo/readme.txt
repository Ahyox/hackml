Open Python via run: type in idle
Open my .py file or copy n paste from notepad verson
EDIT file path to find the csv file (the first line after the imports)

Run the code against your entire dataset in csv format:
 - To do this, I created a function "final_test"
 - final_test('C:/Users/Koye/Desktop/Kaggle/HotelsNG/hotelsng.csv')
 - In the argument, just insert the filepath to your actual larger dataset now

So I've trained on the small dataset, and you're testing my algorithm on your real data (must be in csv)
